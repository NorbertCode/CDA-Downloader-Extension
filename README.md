# CDA Downlader
This is an extension for Chrome, which simplifies downloading videos from cda.pl

Just press the "Download" button it adds to the page or in the extension window and you're good to go!

Works on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, so it should work on most Chromium-based browsers.

# Installation
1. Go to Settings -> Extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Either drag and drop .crx file or press "Load unpacked" and select the source files
